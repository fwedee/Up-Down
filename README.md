# Up&Down

Up&Down is a simple sharing application. Where users can upload a file or multiple files and have access to them via their local network.

### Prerequisites
- you need to add an **.env** file to the project  and set at least the **SECRET_KEY** variable
- python installed 
- (docker installed)

## Useage

Either use without docker by running the run.py. The **benefit** of the docker image is that the program is automatically accessible via the network.

### Without docker 
- just run ```python3 run.py```


### With docker
- just run ```docker-compose up```
